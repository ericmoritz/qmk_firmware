* EAM keymap
** Goals
*** Adhere to QWERTY as close as possible
    I don't like it, but I don't want to feel like my hands are tied at someone else's keyboard
*** Reduce "EMACS pinky as much as possible"
    Avoid chorded sequences with a mod key held down by the pinky. It is the weakest finger and mine gets sore after a while
** Features
*** TODO modifier underglow indicator
*** TODO color blended when multiple modifiers are applied
*** TODO "bilighting"
